# c_budget
c_budget is a command line app built to be compiled and run on a Windows machine.

To use c_budget, first cd to the directory containing c_budget's executable file. For example,

- cd C:\Users\User\c_budget

Next, run c_budget in one of two ways.

1. Type c_budget
2. Type c_budget my_budget_data.txt

If you do not include a file name after typing "c_budget" the default data file will be used, if possible. The default data file name is defined in a macro in the program code.
